# Ncclient: an open source Python NETCONF client module

## Introduction

[Ncclient](https://github.com/ncclient/ncclient) (short for NETCONF client) is an open source
Python module that allows you to develop Python scripts that interact with a NETCONF server.

## Installation


## Starting the clixon NETCONF server

The MG-Soft NETCONF browser is a NETCONF client, so we need a NETCONF server to be running.
In this chapter we will use clixon as the NETCONF server.
Refer to the [clixon chapter in this tutorial](clixon.md) for instructions on how install clixon,
how to build clixon, how the start the clixon backend daemon, and how to configure SSH to start
the clixon NETCONF server.
