# Tail-f ConfD

## Introduction

[Tail-f](https://www.tail-f.com/) is a company that specializes in network programmability and
data model driven device management. 
Tail-f was acquired by [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/) in 2014.

One of their products is ConfD: an on-device network management agent that uses YANG data modeling,
that provides NETCONF and RESTCONF management protocols as well as a command line interface (CLI),
and that provides a centralized transactional configuration database.

Tail-f ConfD comes in two versions:
[ConfD premium](https://www.tail-f.com/management-agent/) which is a paid version,
and [ConfD basic](https://www.tail-f.com/confd-basic/) which is a free version with a subset
of the features.

In this tutorial we use the ConfD basic running on Ubuntu.

TODO: I cannot download ConfD basic. The Tail-f website reports
"ConfD Basic Downloads are temporarily disabled. Please contact confdbasicinfo@cisco.com with any
